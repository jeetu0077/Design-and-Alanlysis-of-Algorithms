Project Name:       To find whether there is an index i for which a[i] = i.

Project Descrition: We use Binary Search to find the index with a[i] = i.
                    We take the size and the elements of the array by the user.
                    If there is such an element then we print "Index with a[i] = i".
                    If there is no such element then we print "There is no such index". 
       
Installation:       Compile the project using command:gcc -o binary binary.c
                    Run the project by using command:./binary

Usage:              This program gives an element from the array whose a[i] = i.
