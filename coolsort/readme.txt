Project Name:       To sort the array by calling insertion sort recursively.

Project Descrition: We take elements of the array by the user.
                    We name this algorithm as Coolsort.
                    We have hard coded the size of the array and sequence to 10 and 3 respectively.
                    This program calls insertion sort recursively.
                    We get the sorted array after all the passes are sorted.
                    

Installation:       Compile the project using command:gcc -o coolsort coolsort.c
                    Run the project by using command:./coolsort

Usage:              This program can be used to sort by using passes. It will sort by one by one passes.
