Project Name:       With the help of the given code of Binary Search Tree by proffesor, add member functions
                    such as preOrder(), inOrder(), nodeCount(), delete(). Further 
                    convert this Binary Search Tree into an AVL tree.

Project Descrition: Performs varios functions like preOrder(), inOrder(), nodeCount(), delete().
                    Converts a Binary Search Tree into a AVL tree. 
       
Installation:       Compile the project using command:gcc -o bsttoavl avltreetester.cpp bsttoavl.cpp
                    Run the project by using command:./bsttoavl

Usage:              This program creates an binary tree. We can perform the following operations
                    1. Insert nodes to the tree
                    2. Print the tree in preOrder
                    3. Print the tree in inOrder
                    4. NodeCount gives the number of nodes
                    5. Deletes a node.
                    6. Balances the tree.
