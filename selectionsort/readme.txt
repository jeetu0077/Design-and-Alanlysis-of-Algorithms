Project Name:       Implementing selection sort using an separate function called SelectionSort().

Project Descrition: We sort an array using selection sort method. 
                    We take elements of the array by the user. 
                    The program is hardcoded with 100 as the capacity of the array.
                    We use function SelectionSort for sorting the array.
                    This program runs O(n^2) times.

Installation:       Compile the project using command:gcc -o selectionsort selectionsort.c
                    Run the project by using command:./selectionsort

Usage:              This program can be used to sort the elements of an array using the selection sort sorting algorithm.
