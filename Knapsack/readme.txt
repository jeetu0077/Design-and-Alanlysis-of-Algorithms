Project Name:       To implement the knapsack as taught in class.

Project Descrition: We have implemented knapsack using Dynamic Programming approach.
                    We have used the steps taught in class to struture the program.
                    We get the Maximum value of the knapsack.   
       
Installation:       Compile the project using command:gcc -o knap knap.c
                    Run the project by using command:./knap

Usage:              This program gives the maximum value that can be carried
